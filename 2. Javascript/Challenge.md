# Challenge: make your webpage dynamic

## Open and close the cart
- add a cart to your page, it should just be fixed to the side, and will cover up some of the main website content when opened
- the cart should have a "close" button, which when clicked collapses the cart (JS maybe?)
- the cart should slide out (from the side or top) when the cart button on the navbar is clicked

## Add and remove items from the cart
- when the add to cart button is clicked
