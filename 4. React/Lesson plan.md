# React

## Limitations of vanilla JS
- JS mainly relates to certain part of the HTML, yet the JS and HTML are separate

## NPM
- what is NPM? Comparison to pip or apt
- ```npm install create-react-app -g```
- ```npm vs npx```
- ```npm init```
- what is ```package.json```?
- ```npm install <package> -S```
- what is node_modules?

## Create React App
- Run CRA (```npx create-react-app <app_name>```)
- Follow instructions (```cd demo```, ```npm start```)
- Explore the file structure and show what's happening
- Show ```index.html``` and change it to prove that that is what the browser is showing
- explain ```npm start``` (not build in) vs ```npm install``` (built in), show scripts attribute of ```package.json```
- [what is ```react-scripts```](npmjs.com/package/react-scripts)?
- [src vs public vs build](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52266892/meaning-of-src-public-and-build-folders)?
- by default 
- Show App.js which contains our first React component

## Let's build some muthafuckin React
- Create a new functional ```hello world``` component in the same file
- Introduce JSX. Show combined HTML and JS
- Import css
- Move the code to a new file
- Explain imports and exports

## Challenge: Make your own product component
- remake the product element that you made in vanilla HTML and JS as a standalone React component

## STATE
- make a click counter component

## Building the project
- npm run build
