# React

## Limitations of vanilla JS
- JS mainly relates to certain part of the HTML, yet the JS and HTML are separate

## Create React App
- Get CRA
- Run CRA
- Follow instructions (cd demo, npm start)
- What's NMP?
- Explore the file structure and show what's happening
- Show index.html
- [src vs public vs build](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52266892/meaning-of-src-public-and-build-folders)?
- Show App.js which contains our first React component

## Let's build some muthafuckin React
- Create a new functional ```hello world``` component in the same file
- Introduce JSX. Show combined HTML and JS
- Import css
- Move the code to a new file
- Explain imports and exports

## Challenge: Make your own product component
- copy the product element that you made in vanilla HTML and JS into React

## STATE

## Building the project
- npm run build
