# Apprentices

Welcome to the apprentice program repo

Here's what we are going to do:
- From scratch we are going to build an online shop, using a state of the art software stack

Specifically, we will cover:
- basic web dev skills: HTML and CSS
- making web pages dynamic: JavaScript
- making APIs
- writing JS projects that scale: React
- writing JS projects that other people can understand: TypeScript
- using other people's code to make things look professional: MaterialUI
- deploying to production and using cloud services: AWS

Why?
- Most of the time people don't know what they don't know, so I'm just here to act as a guide
- I love teaching, and want to experiment with how to get better at it.
- More people need these skills
- We need help developing software from people with these skills

How?
- 2 instructed sessions per week, where I will show you new things
- projects and milestones that have to be hit by each of you independently
- 

What you need?
- VSCode
- GitHub acc
- git bash (if you're on windows)
