# Challenge: Build a static landing page for an online store

Do not worry about the functionality of any of these components, the point of this chapter is to get comfortable with content and styling of webpages.

If you don't get something follow these steps:
1. Google it
2. Post in slack
3. Ask Harry

Spec
- navbar
    - with **links** to other sections of the website (don't worry about the other pages for now)
    - button to view cart
- searchbar
    - area you can type in
    - with a placeholder
- grid of store products
    - product image
    - product title in largest font
    - product price smaller
    - button to add to cart

Extra
- animate the background color of the "add to cart" button on each product when someone hovers over it
- figure out how to use ```@keyframes```
